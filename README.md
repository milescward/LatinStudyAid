# LatinStudyAid

This is the first commit on a project for a Latin Study aid using the CLTK and NLTK.

The program accepts an input of raw text in Latin and returns a list of each word with a corresponding POS tag
and a list of all original words (with stopwords filtered) with their corresponding lemmata.

Goals:

- [X] Provide fuctionality to look up each lemma and provide definitions.
- [ ] Develop a basic UI and test deployment using Django
