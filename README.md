# LatinStudyAid

This is the first commit on a project for a Latin Study aid using the CLTK and NLTK.

The program accepts an input of raw text in Latin and returns a list of each word with a corresponding POS tag
and a list of all original words (with stopwords filtered) with their corresponding lemmata.

In progress goals:

Provide fuctionality to look up each lemma and provide definitions.
Develop a basic UI using Tkinter
